*Last updated: {{ site.time | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}*

## Introduction

This privacy policy describes how our NFC Tool mobile application ("the app", "we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.

**Developer**: Luu Anh Tuan
**Contact**: anhtuanluu36@gmail.com
**GitHub**: [@anhtuanluu36](https://github.com/anhtuanluu36)

## Information We Collect

Our NFC Tool app may collect and process the following types of highly sensitive information when you use NFC functionality:

### Identity Document Data (when reading ID cards)
- Personal identifiers (full name, document number, nationality)
- Demographic information (date of birth, gender, place of birth)
- Family information (father's name, mother's name, spouse's name)
- Address information (permanent address)
- Biometric data (facial photograph)
- Document details (document type, issuing authority, expiration date)
- Other personal information (occupation, identifying marks)

### Payment Card Data (when reading contactless cards)
- Cardholder name
- Primary Account Number (PAN)
- Card expiration date
- Application identifiers and labels
- Transaction history (if available on card)

### NFC Tag Data
- Content stored on NFC tags (URLs, text, contact information)
- Technical tag information and metadata

### Device Information
- NFC hardware capabilities
- Device model and operating system version
- App usage data for functionality improvement

### Local Storage
- NDEF emulation settings and data (stored locally on device)
- App preferences and configuration settings

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information collected by the app solely to:

- **NFC Data Reading**: Process and display information from NFC-enabled cards and tags for your viewing and analysis
- **App Functionality**: Provide NFC reading, writing, and emulation features
- **Local Storage**: Save your emulation settings and preferences locally on your device
- **Security**: Implement secure communication protocols (BAC authentication) for identity document reading
- **User Experience**: Improve app performance and functionality

**🔒 Critical Privacy Protection**: All NFC data processing occurs locally on your device. We do not transmit any personal or sensitive information to external servers, third parties, or cloud services.

## Data Security

Our NFC Tool app implements robust security measures:

- **Local Processing Only**: All sensitive data is processed locally on your device with no internet transmission
- **Secure Protocols**: Uses industry-standard BAC (Basic Access Control) authentication for identity document reading
- **No External Storage**: Personal data is not stored on external servers or cloud services
- **Encryption**: Card communication uses cryptographic protocols for secure data exchange
- **Minimal Permissions**: App requests only essential NFC permissions, no unnecessary access to device features

## Data Retention

- **NFC Read Data**: Information read from cards/tags is displayed temporarily and is not permanently stored by the app
- **Emulation Settings**: NDEF emulation preferences are stored locally until you clear app data or uninstall the app
- **No Remote Storage**: No personal data is retained on external servers or cloud services
- **Local Logs**: Technical logs are stored locally for debugging purposes and do not contain personal information
- **System Backups**: App data may be included in Android system backups if device backup is enabled

## Third-Party Services

Our NFC Tool app maintains strict privacy standards:

- **Does NOT use analytics services** (no Firebase, Google Analytics, or similar)
- **Does NOT use crash reporting services**
- **Does NOT use advertising networks**
- **Does NOT connect to internet** (no network permissions)
- **Does NOT share data with third parties**

The only third-party component is the ACS Smart Card library for secure card communication, which operates entirely locally on your device.

## Permissions

### Required Permissions
Our app requests only the following permissions:

- **NFC Access** (`android.permission.NFC`): Required to read and communicate with NFC-enabled devices
- **NFC Hardware** (`android.hardware.nfc`): Required to access NFC hardware functionality

### Permissions NOT Required
Our app does **NOT** request:
- Internet/Network access
- Location services
- Camera or microphone access
- Device storage access
- Contacts or calendar access
- Phone or SMS access

## Your Rights

You have the following rights regarding your data:

- **Access**: Review what data is temporarily processed by the app
- **Control**: Choose which NFC devices to scan and what data to process
- **Deletion**: Clear app data or uninstall the app to remove all local data
- **Transparency**: This policy provides complete disclosure of our data practices

Since all data processing occurs locally on your device, you maintain complete control over your information.

## Children's Privacy

This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. The sensitive nature of the data this app can read (identity documents, payment cards) makes it unsuitable for use by minors.

## International Users

This app processes data locally on your device regardless of your location. No data is transmitted internationally or stored outside your device.

## App Store Compliance

- **Google Play Store** data safety requirements
- **Apple App Store** privacy guidelines
- **GDPR** data protection regulations (EU)
- **CCPA** consumer privacy rights (California)
- **PIPEDA** privacy requirements (Canada)
- Industry best practices for sensitive data handling

## Data Sharing and Transmission

**We do NOT**:
- Transmit any data over the internet
- Share data with third parties
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Store data in the cloud
- Send data to external servers

**We DO**:
- Process all data locally on your device
- Use secure protocols for card communication
- Respect your privacy and data ownership
- Provide complete transparency about our practices

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify users of any material changes by:

## Legal Compliance

### GDPR (EU Users)
Our legal basis for processing includes:
- Legitimate interest in providing NFC reading functionality
