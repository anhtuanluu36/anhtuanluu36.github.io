## About NFC Tool

My main focus right now is [NFC Tool](/nfc-tool-privacy-policy/), a privacy-focused mobile application for reading and interacting with NFC-enabled devices. The app prioritizes user privacy with:

- **Local-only processing** - No data leaves your device
- **No internet permissions** - Complete offline operation
- **Secure protocols** - Industry-standard encryption for sensitive data
- **Transparent privacy practices** - Open about what data is processed

## Why This Blog?

I believe in sharing knowledge and being transparent about the development process. Whether you're a fellow developer, a user of my apps, or just curious about technology, I hope you'll find value in these posts.
